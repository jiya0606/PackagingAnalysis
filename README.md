Interned under Professor Natalie Carlson from the University of Pennsylvania, Wharton School of Business to explore the impact of immigrant workers on company packaging. My role was to process 150K product images for packaging trends by country, parallel processed in BigQuery, find trends, and analyze trends with find trends with statistical regression. I wrote my findings into a research paper, which can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gh1CVbjx4QJNwDXewdSAgX-8w57ocW8TKpMz0Wx3Ejs/edit?usp=sharing
